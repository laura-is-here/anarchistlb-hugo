Long Beach Anarchist Collective aims to act in solidarity to redistribute food in our city through revitalization of the local [Food Not Bombs project](http://foodnotbombs.net/new_site/). Food Not Bombs is an anarchist mutual aid project in which community members engage in direct action to address disparities in access to quality food.

Food Not Bombs illustrates that direct action can be a viable alternative to reliance on [charities and non-profits](https://incite-national.org/beyond-the-non-profit-industrial-complex/), which reinforce the capitalist system through reproduction of the hierarchies and oppressive structures of that system.

All are welcome to share food with us [unless you're a cop](http://aworldwithoutpolice.org/). We serve food every 2nd and 4th Sunday at Bixby Park. 

For questions or to get involved, please email us at [fnbinthelbc@riseup.net](mailto:fnbinthelbc@riseup.net).
