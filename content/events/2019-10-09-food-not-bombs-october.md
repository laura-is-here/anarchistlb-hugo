Our first Food, Not Bombs food redistribution date was a huge success and learning experience, and we're looking forward to our next event date at the end of this month.

<!--more-->

Please join us on Sunday, October 27th, from 11:30am to 1pm at the center of Bixby Park (across from the bathrooms).

In addition to food, we will also have socks, deodorant, and other hygiene necessities available. We are always looking for donations of these items, so please [email us](mailto:fnbinthelbc@riseup.net) to coordinate a donation if you would like to help.

Again, all are welcome to share food with us [unless you're a cop](http://aworldwithoutpolice.org/). If you're a community member or anarchist looking to get involved or just share a hot meal with us, please stop by!

As always, email us at [fnbinthelbc@riseup.net](mailto:fnbinthelbc@riseup.net) if you'd like to help collect food donations, serve food, or cook with us.
