We've had an outpouring of support for redistributing food and are now happy to announce that we will be able to double our capacity for food redistribution dates.

<!--more-->

Starting this month, we'll be sharing hot meals, fresh groceries, and hygiene items every 2nd and 4th Sunday at Bixby Park. If you are interested in assisting with picking up food, cooking, or serving with us, please contact {{< anchor "fnbinthelbc@riseup.net" "mailto:fnbinthelbc@riseup.net" >}}.

We couldn't be doing this without all the support from Long Beach community members, from those who've helped with Food not Bombs projects in the past to those who are totally new to this type of work. 

Our goal with redistributing food is to address the inherent waste of the capitalist system, as well as the fundamental social relations of that system that dictate the non-equitable distribution of plentiful goods. The majority of our food is donated from local vendors or from potential waste in our own pantries; however, we supplement as needed with storebought goods.

Non-profit groups like Food Finders have access to a variety of grocery items from local stores that would address our need to purchase these storebought goods, but these groups only work with other registered non-profits, which we are not. Even in the non-profit world, capitalist social relations and hierarchies are replicated, privileging certain people over others.

If you'd like to support us with a donation, feel free to contact us to coordinate pickup/dropoff of fresh produce or other vegan canned and dried goods, hygiene items (socks, deodorant, razors, etc, but especially socks!) or {{< anchor "donate to us on ko-fi" "https://ko-fi.com/fnbinthelbc" >}}. We've also started an {{< anchor "Amazon Wishlist" "https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3HFM09HFC5L1P?ref_=wl_share" >}}.
