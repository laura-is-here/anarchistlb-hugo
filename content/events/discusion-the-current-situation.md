Come out this Friday from 6-8 to discuss the current situation in Iran. We will be looking at 4 short texts that discuss past actions to disrupt the US war machine. As anarchists it is our firm belief that the war machine will not be stopped via the electoral process or by hollow protests, direct action and disruption get the goods. 

We will divide our time between discussing the texts and sharing ideas about future actions in Long Beach. If you're angry, if you're filled with the sorrow of war, if you want to burn it all down, or you just want to be with  people who believe that a better world is possible. Come and join us.
