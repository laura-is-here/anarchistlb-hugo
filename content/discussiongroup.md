Long Beach Anarchist Collective will be hosting monthly discussion groups focussing zines, articles, videos, and more.

These discussions are not so much "educational" as they are an opportunity for anarchists and community members to come together and share ideas, struggles, and company.

Our first discussion, coming in October, will center {{< anchor "Why Misogynists Make Great Informants" "https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/courtney-desiree-morris-why-misogynists-make-great-informants" >}}, an article by Courtney Desiree Morris that analyses the consequences of unchecked misogyny for our movements and how this unchecked misogyny benefits the state&mdash;Morris specifically details the story of a misogynist later revealed to be an informant.

For questions or to get involved, please email us at {{< anchor "libsoclb@protonmail.com" "mailto:libsoclb@protonmail.com" >}}.
